The Cardano RealFi Consortium is an independent collective of projects that create value and trust by connecting real world assets and processes to Cardano blockchain transactions and tokens.

We collaborate on solving unique problems that RealFi projects have in common. The Consortium also provides a platform for shared marketing and promotion.
