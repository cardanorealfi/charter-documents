# Rules and regulations

## 1. Membership
The Cardano RealFi Consortium (CRFC) would like to have a low barrier of entry to join the collective but still maintain some membership criteria to ensure that participation is driven by good-faith, active participants. We are working on a two-tier membership structure based on in-kind contributions to CRFC activities. 

## 2. Governance
The following personnel have been appointed to CRFC leadership positions for 3 month terms, each expiring March 1, 2023. 
The CRFC membership may decide to implement longer service position terms at a future business meeting.
